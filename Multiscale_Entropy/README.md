The MSE code used here originated from: https://github.com/nikdon/pyEntropy
Any usage of that code in publsihed work should be credited to the linked public repo and their authors who have developed an easy to understand implementation with references to
related literature. 

MSE_Replication: File containing the analysis for the replication of the arxive preprint study. 

MSE_Demo: File containing different examples of how to use MSE with this type of EEG data and stimuli. Contians useful code snippets and notes.

MSE_EEG: File that was used to produce most of the MSE vectors presented here. 











Note: The pdf is the preprint arxiv of the EEG study that inspired exploring MSE with EEG. I post this for display purposes and to better reference their work. For official purposes, please go and cite their official publication and contact the authors for any questions regarding their interesting work.
