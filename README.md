# EEG_Complexity_Matching
The central question of whether we can find a method to test the theoretical assumption of multiscale compelxity matching of cortical dynamics to corresponding auditory stimuli is an ongoing endeavor in the scientific community and one of the central questions of my dissertation (in progress). The folders are organized to contained various stages of the approach to thsi question. Contents include code and their corresponding reports and presentations for ease of understanding. Much of the work is both unpublished and connected to other published work from colleagues. Published work presented here is for demonstration purposes and not for redistribution, it is advised to always refer to the official publication whenever possible.
