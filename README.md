# EEG_Complexity_Matching
The central question of whether we can find a method to test the theoretical assumption of multiscale compelxity matching of cortical dynamics to corresponding auditory stimuli is an ongoing endeavor in the scientific community and one of the central questions of my dissertation (in progress). The folders are organized to contained various stages of the approach to thsi question. Contents include code and their corresponding reports and presentations for ease of understanding. Much of the work is both unpublished and connected to other published work from colleagues. Published work presented here is for demonstration purposes and not for redistribution, it is advised to always refer to the official publication whenever possible. 

Experiment 1 written report and conference poster presentation are presented here. Secondary exploratory analysis and related code are included in the MSE folder. Other data and code are not archived here. Any queries can be made directly to me about access or preview to that data and code. 




NOTE: As of 2020, the direct progress of this research has been halted due to COVID-19. Parallel attempts to related questions of relating brain responses to incoming auditory input are addressed through the 'Mind Reading' literature and in progress work shared in my other repositories using deep learning methods.
